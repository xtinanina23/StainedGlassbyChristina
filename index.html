            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I've loved art since I could hold a pencil. Creativity and imagination have always been part of who I am—I spent countless hours as a child drawing, coloring, and experimenting with different materials. My summers were filled with art classes that deepened my passion and exposed me to new techniques. This dedication led me to pursue a formal education in fine arts, where I specialized in drawing and painting. My foundation in traditional art has greatly influenced the way I approach stained glass, combining attention to detail with a strong sense of composition and color.</p>
            <p>After finishing school, I began working as an apprentice in stained glass, learning the craft from experienced artisans and immersing myself in the meticulous process of cutting, leading, and soldering. Over the past five years, I’ve honed my skills and now work full-time specializing in stained glass window restoration. My work primarily focuses on bringing historical church windows back to life, but I also enjoy creating new, custom designs that add character and beauty to modern spaces. I take pride in blending artistry with craftsmanship to preserve the legacy of stained glass while pushing its creative boundaries.</p>
